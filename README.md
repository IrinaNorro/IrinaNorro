## Soft skills

  ### Problem Solver
    Hit me with a challenge and I will get back to you with a solution. I don't give up on obstacles, always find my way. 
    And also highly value other people's deep knowledge and not afraid to ask for help and quidance when needed. 
  
  ### Team Player
    Studying during Covid got me finally realize I really enjoy people's company and good team work, where the whole team 
    is determined in finding a solution for a challenge. But I do also enjoy peace and silence from time to time and 
    concentrate best in my own company. 
  
  ### Multitalent
    I have wide expertise in Team Assistant / Executive Assistant roles, where I have diven in exciting world of 
    - Customer Service
    - HR
    - Financial Management 
    
    I have also wide expertise in Health Care, Education and Early Education and have experience in following areas:
    - Early Childhood Pedagogy
    - School Assistance
    - Care for people with Special need
    - Care for Elderly
    And have used many various technologies in these Industries in daily work life.
    
    I see this as a huge advantage when possibly working in future with customers in different industries. 
    I have understanding in people's needs in these areas, which helps to relate to their challenges and 
    may help in finding better solutions.
    
    I can handle anything starting from HealtTech, EdTech, Finance, CRM, HR and beyond. 
  
  ### Internationality
     I have moved to three countries, to Finland, Germany and South-Korea in roles of student and guest worker in Education and 
     Hotel Industry. I can speak or listen more or less fluently six languages. I have also travelled a lot, and met people from 
     around the Globe. I find it natural to include different people from different backgrounds in converstations. I was working 
     in multinational company (Wipro) and that gave me also confidence to use English in everyday life. 

  ### Stubborn
    Or maybe you want to call it determined. It got me to places and got me achieve many dreams. 
  
  ### Patient
    My previous work surrounded me by bunch of impatient kids has taught me a lot of patience. 
    Until I started to code. Then I realized I had no clue. 
    But have improved a lot. I even enjoy it now.
  
  ### Being comfy in discomfort zone. 
    Getting myself in new unknown situations is my middle name. I like exploring new areas, places, ideas, 
    life stories of people. I think this is one of my biggest advantages when learning to code. 

 ### Pursuing Imperfection
    “It is wise to recognize we are all imperfect in some way.”
    And also, pursuing towards being more imperfect, sometimes it's hard, but I'm getting better at it every day. 
    I have also learned to focus on important and urgent stuff first. 
    It is great wisdom to know when to stop. Perfectionists get rarely things done by given deadline, don't you think. 

 ### Random stuff about me
   - Wouldn't call myself a joke generator, but I do love to laugh at other people's (bad) jokes. Just give it a try :D 
   - Travelled 20 000 km by train from Finland to Southern China. 
   - Love to hang around at our summer cottage by the sea.
   - Enjoy hiking in jungles in Brasil, Buddhist pilgrimages in China or fills in Lapland.
   - And I just resently learned downhill skiing.
