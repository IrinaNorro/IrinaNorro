# About me

## Hard skills
  Currently concentrating on learning UiPath and Python. 
  
## Soft skills

  ### Stubborn
    Or maybe you want to call it determined. It's all the same to me. It got me to places and got me achieve many dreams. 
  
 ### Patient
    My previous work surrounded my bunch of screaming (impatient) kids has taught me a lot of patience. 
    Until I started to code. Then I realized I had no clue. 
    But I'm improving.
  
  ### Being comfy in discomfort zone. 
    Getting myself in new unknown situations is my middle name. Mabye I get the kick, I don't know. 
   <!-- You might get the hinch if you get a closer look at MY PATH (Resume). -->

 ### Imperfect
    “It is wise to recognize we are all imperfect in some way.”
    And also, pursuing towards being more imperfect, sometimes it's hard, but I'm getting better at it every day. 
    Perfectionists get rarely things done by given deadline, don't you think. 

 ### Random stuff
    Wouldn't call myself a joke generator, but I do love to laugh at other people's (bad) jokes. Just give it a try :D 
    Moved to three countries. (Can speak or listen more or less fluently six languages.)
    Travelled 20 000 km by train. 
    Studying my third degree.
    Love to hang around at our summer cottage by the sea.
    Just resently learned downhill skiing.
