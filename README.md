## Soft skills

  ### Problem Solver
    Hit me with a challenge and I will get back to you with a solution. I don't give up on obstacles, always find my way. 
    And also highly value other people's deep knowledge and not afraid to ask for help and quidance when needed. 
  
  ### Team Player
    Studying during Covid got me finally realize I really enjoy people's company and good team work, where the whole team is determined
    in finding a solution for a challenge. But I do also enjoy peace and silence from time to time and concentrate best in my own company. 

  ### Stubborn
    Or maybe you want to call it determined. It got me to places and got me achieve many dreams. 
  
  ### Patient
    My previous work surrounded me by bunch of impatient kids has taught me a lot of patience. 
    Until I started to code. Then I realized I had no clue. 
    But have improved a lot. I even enjoy it now.
  
  ### Being comfy in discomfort zone. 
    Getting myself in new unknown situations is my middle name. I like exploring new areas, places, ideas, life stories of people. 
    I think this is one of my biggest advantages in learning to code. 

 ### Pursuing Imperfection
    “It is wise to recognize we are all imperfect in some way.”
    And also, pursuing towards being more imperfect, sometimes it's hard, but I'm getting better at it every day. 
    I have also learned to focus on important and urgent stuff first. 
    It is great wisdom to know when to stop. Perfectionists get rarely things done by given deadline, don't you think. 

 ### Random stuff about me
    Wouldn't call myself a joke generator, but I do love to laugh at other people's (bad) jokes. Just give it a try :D 
    Moved to three countries, to Finland, Germany, South-Korea. Can speak or listen more or less fluently six languages.
    Travelled 20 000 km by train. 
    Studying my third degree.
    Love to hang around at our summer cottage by the sea.
    Just resently learned downhill skiing.
